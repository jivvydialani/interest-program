### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

I was tasked to design a mobile application to address the user's need for a simple and efficient way to track their daily weight and progress toward their goal weight. It aims to provide a user-friendly interface for logging daily weight, setting a goal weight, and receiving notifications when their goal weight is achieved. The app was intended to cater to users with a variety of health and fitness goals, including weight loss, maintenance, and tracking for medical reasons.

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

To support user needs and create a user-centered UI for the app, I had to develop several screen and implement some functionality. I started with a Login/Register screen, which is essential for user authentication and account creating. Next, I designed and developed the Dashboard to display daily weights with dates, and button for weight entry, edit entry, and goal setting. I then developed the screens for each of the buttons and an additional screen for the notification mechanism. The UI designs kept users in mind by focusing on simplicity, clarity, and consistency. I focused on the essential elements to avoid overwhelming users. I labeled icons and buttons clearly for easy identification and interaction. I maintained consistent design elements and layouts across screens. These designs were successful because they prioritized user experience, ensuring that users could navigate the app seamlessly and intuitively.

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

The process of coding the application was done incrementally. I first planned and designed the application. Then, I created the screens, added the components, and added the functionality to the components. I divided the app's functionalities into smaller modules or components, making it easier to manage and debug the code. I aimed to write reusable code snippets and functions, which could be used in multiple parts of the app, reducing redundancy and making maintenance easier. In the future, I could apply these strategies or techniques in different types of projects. For example, I will properly plan a project's structure and functionalities before coding because it helps in creating a clear roadmap and reduces the chances of getting stuck during development. I will continue to break down projects into smaller, reusable components, which allows for easier debugging, scalability, and code maintenance.

### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

To ensure the functionality of my code, I conducted uunit tests to validate individual functions and methods, ensuring they produced the expected outputs for various inputs. I performed user accpetance testing; I simulated real-world user scenarios to ensure that the app behaved as expected from an end-user perspective. This testing process was important because it helped in identifying and fixing bugs, ensuring the stability and reliability of the app. It also revealed any inconsistencies or unexpected behavior that needed to be addressed. By catching these issues early on, I could prevent potential problems and provide a better user experience.

----
### Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

Most of the challeneges I faced was during the process of coding. Implementing a notification mechanism to alert users when they achieved their goal weight was especially challenging for me. This involved integrating with the Android notification system and setting up triggers to send notifications when the user's current weight matched their goal weight. Unfortunately, I was unable to properly code this functionality.

### In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The course I took previously involved SQL and databases, so the information was still fresh going into this course. Designing a database schema that could efficiently store and retrieve large amounts of weight data while ensuring data integrity. This involved using appropriate data types and indexing to optimize query performance. Overall, my successful implementation of these features in my mobile app demonstrated my ability to apply my knowledge, skills, and experience in a real-world software development project.
